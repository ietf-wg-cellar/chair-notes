   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

###  Milestone review:

   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought
   * Is it worth publishing an update to ffv1-v4 that includes the goals we've discussed previously?
   * Are we ready to submit a working group draft for EBML updates (errata plus additions) yet? (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/tree/corrections-doc)
   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC.

##### Discussion on the call
   * Almost all the Matroska issues have PRs waiting for reviews - 7 do not. Steve will work on this during the coming week, and then send a version for review (soon) (after the PRs are merged)
   * Jerome is now able to focus on FFV1-v4, since we've published FFV1. **ACTION** Spencer to send e-mail to DISPATCH when we submit a (small) update.
   * We should wait until we have a bit more text, or bigger issues, to publish as a draft.

#### Michael Richardson has asked to step down as co-chair for SOME WORKING GROUP, after years of service in this role.
   * This may be CELLAR, but also may not be. He's asked the ADs to pick one.
   * We need to have a conversation about succession planning.
   * Michael and Spencer are both IETF process resources, not technical resources - it would be good to have at least one of each.
   * We could be using document shepherds to develop talent, but they need to be involved with our work, on calls, etc.
   * Open call on the Cellar mailing list? Michael has reached out to individuals in the past - that worked with Matroska.
   * IETF working groups do not name their own leadership - that's an Area Director responsibity - but ADs make their best choices when they have all the information we can give them to make choices.

#### Accept draft minutes from previous meeting (attached below)

 * Any objections? Please let us know on the mailing list.

#### Follow-up on Possible switch to Meetecho for our calls

##### Discussion on previous calls
* We discussed moving to Meetecho (from whereby.com) at the May meeting, and Spencer had an action to check on iOS and Android clients for Meetecho.
* Spencer verified that Meetecho uses WebRTC, so should work with any browser, but does **not** currently have an iOS or Android client available.
*  Michael's experience is that Meetecho REALLY needs to run from a computer, and not a phone or tablet, just because you need a lot of screen real estate to keep track of queues, chats, and other stuff.

##### Discussion on the call
   * Is using a computer for Cellar interim meetings a dealbreaker for anyone?
   * None on the call ...
   * **ACTION** Spencer will request Meetecho for our September meeting.

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
   * Michael presented slides for  https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob/master/ffv1-v4-goals.md at the IETF 111 Dispatch session.
   * https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-111-dispatch-cellar-wg-overview-00

### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/532 "possible values"  maybe "defined values"...
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/530 can be merged.
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/437

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
   * Were not discussed on the call

## AOB?
   * None noted, except that Spencer and Michael expressed their appreciation for the people in the working group!
