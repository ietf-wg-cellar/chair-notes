###  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4-17 was posted 2021-05-25, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-01 was posted 2021-04-27, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-07 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

###  Milestone review: 


   * Previous status: Jerome is now able to focus on FFV1-v4, since we've published FFV1. **ACTION** Spencer to send e-mail to DISPATCH when we submit a (small) update. We should wait until we have a bit more text, or bigger issues, to publish as a draft. 
   * Are we ready to submit a working group draft for EBML updates (errata plus additions) yet? (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/tree/corrections-doc)
   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 

##### Discussion on the call
   * Steve is waiting for reviews on Matroska (should we just merge everything? :-) Timescale looks like the tricky question, for now. Can start preliminary review on merged documents then. Planning to sort IDs for IANA (we have over 100 of them) - want to make sure this is easy to verify correctness. 
   **IANA will accept XML file for everything**
   * When RFC for Matroska is published, do we have to do anything to update links to Internet-Drafts? No, that's handled by IANA. 

#### Accept draft minutes from previous meeting (attached below)

 * Any objections? Please let us know on the mailing list. 
 * No objections during the call. 

### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
 * Mostly validating patches and approving them

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
 * Jerome has ideas for proof of concepts, but not ready to share that yet. 
 * Some questions about licensing in IETF - license on FFV1 not present, patch has been approved and applied. License is same as Matroska. 

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
 * (We noted that we don't have the original FLAC authors involved - we probably need to do some homework on this, to ensure that we handle copyright for FLAC correctly)
 * Remember to mention the FLAC format author(s) - "Josh Coalson", copyrights in 2009 and 2011 on the website
 * Martijn van Beurden would like to help, and has experience on libFLAC. For now, we just need to make sure that everything in the documents makes sense/is logical. If anything is missing, we just need to create issues (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/Cellar-FLAC/issues) and PRs for that. 

## AOB?
 * Spencer welcomed Martijn van Beurden and thanked him for his offer of help on FLAC

   * Please note our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
   * IETF 112 will also be a fully online meeting (announced 2021-08-04), so **we will not be meeting face-to-face in Madrid, right?** Perhaps in early December, close to Amsterdam with a workshop on FFv1 and Matroska (also in person) More info at https://mediaarea.net/NoTimeToWait5

### News You Can Use

###  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was **PUBLISHED AS RFC 9043**
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4-17 was posted 2021-05-25, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-01 was posted 2021-04-27, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-07 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

###  Milestone review: 

   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought 
   * Is it worth publishing an update to ffv1-v4 that includes the goals we've discussed previously?
   * Are we ready to submit a working group draft for EBML updates (errata plus additions) yet? (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/tree/corrections-doc)
   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 

##### Discussion on the call
   * Almost all the Matroska issues have PRs waiting for reviews - 7 do not. Steve will work on this during the coming week, and then send a version for review (soon) (after the PRs are merged)
   * Jerome is now able to focus on FFV1-v4, since we've published FFV1. **ACTION** Spencer to send e-mail to DISPATCH when we submit a (small) update.
   * We should wait until we have a bit more text, or bigger issues, to publish as a draft. 

#### Michael Richardson has asked to step down as co-chair for SOME WORKING GROUP, after years of service in this role. 
   * This may be CELLAR, but also may not be. He's asked the ADs to pick one. 
   * We need to have a conversation about succession planning. 
   * Michael and Spencer are both IETF process resources, not technical resources - it would be good to have at least one of each. 
   * We could be using document shepherds to develop talent, but they need to be involved with our work, on calls, etc. 
   * Open call on the Cellar mailing list? Michael has reached out to individuals in the past - that worked with Matroska. 
   * IETF working groups do not name their own leadership - that's an Area Director responsibity - but ADs make their best choices when they have all the information we can give them to make choices. 

#### Accept draft minutes from previous meeting (attached below)

 * Any objections? Please let us know on the mailing list. 
   
#### Follow-up on Possible switch to Meetecho for our calls

##### Discussion on previous calls
* We discussed moving to Meetecho (from whereby.com) at the May meeting, and Spencer had an action to check on iOS and Android clients for Meetecho. 
* Spencer verified that Meetecho uses WebRTC, so should work with any browser, but does **not** currently have an iOS or Android client available. 
*  Michael's experience is that Meetecho REALLY needs to run from a computer, and not a phone or tablet, just because you need a lot of screen real estate to keep track of queues, chats, and other stuff.

##### Discussion on the call
   * Is using a computer for Cellar interim meetings a dealbreaker for anyone?
   * None on the call ... 
   * **ACTION** Spencer will request Meetecho for our September meeting.

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
   * Michael presented slides for  https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob/master/ffv1-v4-goals.md at the IETF 111 Dispatch session.
   * https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-111-dispatch-cellar-wg-overview-00
   
### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/532 "possible values"  maybe "defined values"... 
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/530 can be merged.
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/pull/437

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
   * Were not discussed on the call

## AOB?
   * None noted, except that Spencer and Michael expressed their appreciation for the people in the working group!
