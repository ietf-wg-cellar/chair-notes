###  Milestone review:

   * Previous status: Jerome is now able to focus on FFV1-v4, since we've published FFV1.
       **ACTION** Spencer to send e-mail to DISPATCH when we submit a (small) update. We should wait until we have a bit more text, or bigger issues, to publish as a draft.

   * Are we ready to submit a working group draft for EBML updates (errata plus additions) yet? (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/tree/corrections-doc)
       * we can still wait for more feedback/bigger changes before submitting anything - ETA is "after we get Matroska out, so we know everything Matroska needs will be covered"
       * also have some implementation/experience reports.

### FLAC as Standards Track or Informational
   * PR #135 is OK to push
   * Closed for now

### errata to acknowledge the MP4 registry work for FFV1
   * as listed in https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cellar/kcchQqo6aq2veXijhwVmozQDLCc/.
   * Steve will enter errata for this
   * Need to add same material for FFV1-V4 but we do this in GitHub, because that's not a published RFC
   * https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob…master/ffv1.md#matroska-file-format=
   * See https://mp4ra.org/#/codecs and search FFV1

### ?? email on #matroska-user with the subject "[Matroska-users] Video Coding History questions”
   * Postponed to April meeting

### push matroska-09 and submit it for review to the higher powers
   * One remaining issue, and it's unrelated
   * Ready to push this one now.
   * We'll initiate WGLC and forward email to appropriate mailing lists outside IETF.
   * Will be four week WGLC with two-week reminder

### publish codec-08 and tags-08 as well since they seem to expire in April
   * (but "Codec changes include proper reference to the (renamed) UncompressedFourCC element and AVS3 codec" and "Tags have the new TVDB2 tag")
   * will publish when they expire - they're not being WGLCed

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
   * Two new issues, please review
   * Issues #145 and #146

### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
   * Can defer this and focus on codecs and tags until after WGLC

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
   * No updates on this call
   * We need to discuss directions on the April call
