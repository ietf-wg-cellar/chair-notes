###  Milestone review:

   * FLAC waiting for Shepherd write up from Spencer

### Matroska issues - Discussion of [AD review comments from Murray Kucherawy](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cellar/waY3cjku6hhTQ16do1wC7XNsXzQ/) on the call.

   * document has been returned with AD comments
   * Steve Lhomme has been very responsive in providing PRs and explanations to Murray (**Thank you, Steve!**)
   * One PR is still open - we'll discuss on the call
   * Our UIDs are not UUIDs - they're not what the IETF calls UUIDs. 
   * The UUID specification is being revised, but we can recommend calling them UUID v4 and treat them as an opaque 128-bit string. 
   * We have no idea what UUID v8 will be, of course ...
   * Do we forbid reuse of deprecated IDs? That's maximum compatibility, but reduces the size of the available ID space. 
   * We don't know of usages (many? most?), but we can't know that no one has used a deprecated code point. 
   * We can mark the deprecated IDs as "returned" not as "reserved", and we can instruct IANA to use "returned" IDs last.
   * This is for one-byte IDs - we can just lose the longer ID codes. We did this with DHCP option codes, so we have prior art here, including collisions because people were reusing "unused" option codes without coordinating with others, and how to recover from that situation. 
   * Spencer noted that this is a working group document, so we should make sure the working group still agrees with the document after changes. 

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call

   * OPUS talks a lot about encoding, and the FLAC specification doesn't. Is that OK?
   * We tend to focus on decoders, and allow encoders to innovate. We can say what we want to say, but we should make a decision explicitly.
   * Martijn is still experimenting and making small corrections and clarifications, and that's fine. 
   * We think June is a reasonable timeframe now.

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call

   * No discussion on the call.
   * small wish list is in issue tracker: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/issues
   * next meeting, we will go through the issues and prioritize them.

## AOB?

   * Next meeting is 2023-02-28
   * Implementation report: ffmpeg has ffv1 in MXF patch!
