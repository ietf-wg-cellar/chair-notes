   * Are we ready to submit a working group draft for EBML updates (errata plus additions) yet? (https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/tree/corrections-doc) - we can still wait for more feedback/bigger changes before submitting anything - ETA is "after we get Matroska out, so we know everything Matroska needs will be covered"
   * **Have we selected a new editor for FLAC?** actually, no, and we need to. This work is heating up, but until this becomes a bottleneck, we can wait until Matroska is out

#### Accept draft minutes from previous meeting (attached below)

   * Any objections? Please let us know on the mailing list. 
   * No objections on the mailing list or on the call. 

### Making sure we have copyright issues straightened out for the FLAC specification 
   * Remember, the issue we care about right now is whether the IETF can publish a FLAC specification
   * Our "last Contact" for the specification we're working with, is "Copyright (c) 2000-2009 Josh Coalson, 2011-2014 Xiph.Org Foundation" (https://xiph.org/flac/format.html)

##### Discussion on the call
   * We are still verifying what the license covering the specification is - it's GFL 1.1, specified in the HTML file 
   * Continue with the current document, or start a new one?
   * Dave has confirmed with Andrew Weaver that he's not interested in continuing the work
   * Our issue is that the IETF licensing is incompatible with GFL license, because we're using copyright as a substitute for a trademark, since trademark doesn't exist in all countries
   * This is probably a conversation we should have with the IETF Trust
   * We should also give our ADs a heads-up
   * Michael is writing a note to the IETF Trust on our call, asking for guidance

### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
   * Merging the easy PRs for now 
   * Two categories of issues are left
   * Checking with Moritz on 3-4 pull requests, can move ahead without a reply
   * Steve - we're close to being ready for a full review
   * New Matroska docs were taken out of the main specification, and aren't blocking for us to move forward
   * Both new documents need closer looks and discussion

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
   * Lots of open issues and PRs are new
   * We have a new version, being posted manually
   * ("Ongoing")
   * We need to track our changes to FLAC while we chase down the plan for dealing with the original text

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
   * No discussion on the call

## AOB?
   * We have new test files repos  - **ACTION** Spencer to update our activity report
   * We will meet on Whereby in November meeting, and then (try to) migrate to MeetEcho as a group
   * Keep an eye on CoViD-19 situations no matter where you are and where you will be!
