### Logistics for Meeting

#### 2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
:::warning
Note that we do not have a July meeting - (Virtual) IETF 111 will be 2021-07-26 to 2021-07-30.
Qur next meeting will be 2021-08-24 :zap:
:::
   * IETF 111 in July will definitely be virtual. 
   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, weâ€™ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

#### Shared COMIMD for notetaking: https://codimd.ietf.org/notes-cellar-virtual
       
* Note that if you log in to the IETF datatracker, you'll 
       be able to edit these notes, add your name to attendee 
       lists, etc. 
* Please ask Spencer if you have questions.

#### APPEAR.IN is now called "whereby.com" (https://whereby.com/cellar-interim)

## Agenda Items

### Note Well:  https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/

#### Roll call

  Attendees
   * Spencer Dawkins
   * Michael Richardson
   * Jerome Martinez
   * Michael Niedermeier
   * Steve Lhomme

  Regrets 
   *  Reto Kromer

### Accept draft minutes from previous meeting (attached below)

 * Any objections? None noted, 
   
#### Follow-up on Meetecho

* We discussed moving to Meetecho (from whereby.com) at the May meeting, and Spencer had an action to check on iOS and Android clients for Meetecho. 
* Spencer verified that Meetecho uses WebRTC, so should work with any browser, but does **not** currently have an iOS or Android client available. 

#### Discussion on the call
   * Michael's experience is that Meetecho REALLY needs to run from a computer, and not a phone or tablet, just because you need a lot of screen real estate to keep track of queues, chats, and other stuff.
   * Is that a dealbreaker for anyone?

###  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was posted 2021-02-23, is now in RFC Editor Queue, in AUTH48 (see [AUTH48] below)
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4-17 was posted 2021-05-25, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-01 was posted 2021-04-27, in ID Exists 
   * draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-07 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

###  Milestone review: 

   * Close to celebrating on FFv1, but we need to get through AUTH48
   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought 
   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 

#### Discussion on the call
   *

### From the mailing list: From Steve, on EBML errata
   * We are proceeding with a short RFC that UPDATES RFC 8794, not replacing that RFC, and this draft will contain only corrections for the errata we are aware of. 
   * Jerome asked for an example of such an RFC - Spencer suggested https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8540/ on the mailing list ("Subject: Sample draft for updating RFC 8794"), with suggestions for how to map that example onto the new Cellar draft. 
   * Steve submitted https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/pull/413 to get this started - so we can reasonably 
   1. pick a date for this milestone, and 
   2. ask our AD to approve a new milestone (probably "Submit specification for RFC 8794 corrections to IESG (Standards Track)"), to make sure that we can publish this specification when that's appropriate.

#### Discussion on the call
   * Jerome has been working on this. 
   * We probably shouldn't plan to finish our EBML corrections draft before we finish Matroska, because we may find things in EBML that need to be corrected for Matroska.
   * 

### AUTH48 for draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20

Email subject: AUTH48 [JM]: RFC 9043 <draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20.txt> NOW AVAILABLE

#### Discussion on the call
   * We didn't have Dave, but Jerome was also working on these corrections with the RFC Editor.
   * Jerome thinks that all of the corrections have been agreed by all of the authors.
   * ACTION: The authors should review the text provided by the RFC Editor and (if no further changes is needed) just reply toall to the AUTH48 email thread and say "I agree with the most recent text provided by the RFC Editor".
   * Michael and Spencer will be watching that e-mail thread in case the RFC Ediror identifies any changes that need to be approved by the document shepherd (which is Michael in this case). 

### FFV1 v4 issues 
   * We agreed at our previous meeting that we would use work on the introduction to the FFV1 v4 document as a way of agreeing on contents for FFV1v4, and Jerome said he would start work on the Introduction (added as an issue)
   * https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob/master/ffv1-v4-goals.md as our current plan

#### Discussion on the call
   * We discussed https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob/master/ffv1-v4-goals.md on the call.
   * What about infrared images? That could immediately interest people like autonomous vehicle community (who have money).
   * What about signatures for stored media? 
     * What is needed here? Integrity, nonrepudiation, timestamps, ... we may need to talk about specific use cases to understand the requirements.
   * No change to the current document contents for now
   * We can talk about this on the mailing list between now and IETF 111, and then between IETF 111 and our next working group meeting
   * ACTION: Spencer can take the action to do a short presentation in ARTAREA at IETF 111 in July, showing the proposed contents for FFV1 v4 and pointing people to Cellar.
   * 
   
### Matroska issues
   * 

### FLAC issues
   * 
    
## AOB?

   3c) Roll call
   
   3d) One-time Item: Changes to logistics (IRC, Jabber, Whereby, Meetecho ...)
   
   * Existing IRC server has been "taken over". Are we moving? Not moving yet, but we have a candidate server to move to. We can keep both channels open, for the time being. Actually using Github for most conversations for FFV1 and Matroska. 
   * (Is there an iOS or Android app? Spencer will check!)

4.  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was posted 2021-02-23, is now in RFC Editor Queue

   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

5.  Milestone review: 

   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought 

Action: we're making a lot of progress on this - we just need to figure out where we are
   * We had the big text move this month, We've submitted several issues as a part of this with known fixes. 

   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 

* FFV1-v4 requires more research, and it is unclear when we will know what a realistic goal date is. 

5.  2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
   * IETF 111 in July will definitely be virtual. 
   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, weâ€™ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

6.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on EBML errata
   * Spencer thought we submitted errata last time, but https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=8794&rec_status=15&presentation=table doesn't show any errata of any status - did this happen?
   * We have 2 merged changes and 2 pending changes in Github
   * In mailing list discussion, we think we have about four pages of text, with the identified errata, and the change to IANA instructions
   * Murray said that's likely fine as an Updates RFC, rather than a much bigger RFC that replaces RFC 8794
   * Are we OK with producing a short RFC that would update the EBML RFC, probably around end-of-summer?
   * Jerome asked for an example of such an RFC - Spencer can provide this. 

7.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on Matroska #495 section reordering
   * Steve rebuilt the txt/html files and sent before/after to the mailing list
   * Are we all happy with this? We are all happy.
   * Do we need to do anything else?
   * Merged during interim meeting
    
8.   FFV1 v4 issues 
   * Last month, we said we need some working group time to brainstorm on v4 - we can do this as a meeting, on the mailing list, or more broadly
   * What would a good plan look like? Can we schedule that time now?
   * Jerome said he would start work on the Introduction (added as an issue)
   * https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/blob/master/ffv1-v4-goals.md as our current plan
   * We need to discuss line by line on the mailing list. 
   
9.  Matroska issues
   * Merged 512.
   * We will experiment with 513 (as in PR).
   * We'll take a littme more time with 511.
   * Merged 489.
   * 487 - adding a sentence that no known Matroska players use these elements. 
   * Merged 475 - not possible to have values except 1 or 0. Removed support for other values in 2004.
   * Merged 498.
   * We note there are elements with ranges but also restrictions. We could remove the ranges but then we don't know how to validate values. We'll create an issue on this (do restrictions have priority over ranges?)

10. FLAC issues
   *
