   3c) Roll call

4.  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was posted 2021-02-23, is now in RFC Editor Queue
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4-16 was posted 2020-12-01, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-01 was posted 2021-04-27, in ID Exists (thank you, Dave, for submitting this)
   * draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-07 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists

5.  Milestone review: 

   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought 

Action: we're making a lot of progress on this - we just need to figure out where we are

   * FLAC still needs an editor to complete the work. Michael did hear back from Florin, and he's unable to serve as editor, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 
    Dave is working on https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/Cellar-FLAC/pull/92, making changes for XML2RFCv3 and making sure we have valid authors (not organizations) with email addresses (by working group last call)

* FFV1-v4 requires more research, and it is unclear when we will know what a realistic goal date is. 
    

5.  2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
   * IETF 111 in July will definitely be virtual (announced last week). 
   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, we’ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

6.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on EBML errata
   * Spencer thought we submitted errata last time, but https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=8794&rec_status=15&presentation=table doesn't show any errata of any status - did this happen?
   * We have 2 merged changes and 2 pending changes in Github
   * In mailing list discussion, we think we have about four pages of text, with the identified errata, and the change to IANA instructions
   * Murray said that's likely fine as an Updates RFC, rather than a much bigger RFC that replaces RFC 8794
   * Are we OK with producing a short RFC that would update the EBML RFC, probably around end-of-summer?

7.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on Matroska #495 section reordering
   * Steve rebuilt the txt/html files and sent before/after to the mailing list
   * Are we all happy with this?
   * Do we need to do anything else?
    
8.   FFV1 v4 issues 
    * Last month, we said we need some working group time to brainstorm on v4 - we can do this as a meeting, on the mailing list, or more broadly
    * What would a good plan look like? Can we schedule that time now?
    * Jerome said he would start work on the Introduction (added as an issue)
    * 
   
9.  Matroska issues
   * 

10. FLAC issues
   * 
    
AOB?

4.  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-06 was posted 2021-04-12, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was posted 2021-02-23, is now in RFC Editor Queue

   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-00 was posted 2019-07-30, has Expired (and we still don't have an editor, correct?)



5.  Milestone review: 
   * Michael has requested that the RFC Editor move the FFv1 normative reference to Matroska informative, and this has happened. Do we also need to move two other normative references in FFv1 to informative?

Action: Michael will send email to AD and RFC-Editor requesting this, so we won't have to talk about this in AUTH48
    DONE.

   * Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought 

Action: we're making a lot of progress on this - we just need to figure out where we are

   * "Matroska" includes -codec and -tags, correct? Spencer has updated this in the datatracker.

   * FLAC just needs an editor to complete the work. Michael still hasn't heard from Florin, so the working group has a decision to make about FLAC. 

Action: Dave will submit an update on this. 
    We need to chase Florin down and get an answer.
    Dave is working on https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/Cellar-FLAC/pull/92, making changes for XML2RFCv3 and making sure we have valid authors (not organizations) with email addresses (by working group last call)

* FFV1-v4 requires more research, and it is unclear when we will know what a realistic goal date is. 
    

5.  2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/

   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, we’ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

6.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on EBML errata
   * we have 2 merged changes and 2 pending changes in Github
   * What needs to happen next?
   * https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.php#reportnew
   * On the call - we're submitting the pending changes in the errata system

7.  From the mailing list: From Steve, on Matroska #495 section reordering
   * Steve volunteered to rebuild the txt/html files and send before/after to the mailing list
   * Do we need to do anything else?
   * No other action needed - 
Action: Steve, please proceed as you suggested!
    
8.   FFV1 v4 issues 
    * No work on FFV4 to report this month
    * Status: somewhat stalled at the moment. We've mostly collected information for v4 while working on the v1-v3 document, and need some brainstorming time. 
    * We think getting the v1-v3 document will help gather critical mass in the working group.
    * We do need some working group time to brainstorm on v4 - we can do this as a meeting, on the mailing list, or more broadly.
    * What are the goals for v4? Compressed frames that expand are already in v4. We've identified some bugs, and we have some ideas in Github. We have a requirement for another color scheme (two greens)
    * Starting to focus on the Introduction would also be useful (added as an issue) - Jerome will start work on this
    * We can put ideas in the Introduction first, and then either add them to the spec or remove them from the Introduction as work proceeds.
   
9.  Matroska issues
   * 

10. FLAC issues
   * Michael has reached out to Florin to see about his interest in helping with this document, but we don't have an answer from him. 
       * no response to email April 27.

ACTION: Dave will repost flac document with new version number.
    DONE during the meeting.
    
AOB?
