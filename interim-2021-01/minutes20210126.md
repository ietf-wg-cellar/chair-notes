      Could use a new editor for this document.
      Do the contributors know they are covered by NoteWell.
        Spencer to check contribution file, check that this is in our weekly summary, etc.
        Maybe Florian Weimer!
   * We agreed at the December meeting that we would have a focused conversation about FFV1 v4 in our February meeting, and noted then that the April 2021 date is not realistic.

5. 2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note that the proposed 2021 dates discussed at our previous meeting are now official, approved by our AD, and listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, weâ€™ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

6. remaining FFV1 issues from DISCUSS
   * IESG ballot positions at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1/ballot/
   * Have we closed on Barry's concerns about section 3.8.1.x? Not quite yet - we just need to rewrite this section into text, rather than explaining the bespoke notation we're using.
   * Any remaining comments from any ADs that still need to be addressed?
   * If all of the above, what needs to happen to submit an updated draft?

Jerome, Michael and DR will organize a time to redo the 3.8.1 formula into more clear pseudo-code.


7. From private e-mail to Spencer, now forwarded to the mailing list: "What is the canonical procedure to create an "infinite" audio stream, using ~~Opus and~~ FLAC codecs?"

        I have been attempting to locate a site which streams Opus continuously to test.

		I also am interested in the exact opusenc, et al. commands necessary to achieve creation of live audio streams.

		The use cases are implementation of user-defined Web radio station, the capability to play the "infinite" stream using HTMLAudioElement (WHATWG/HTML) over HTTP.

		("infinite" is quoted here as there is no way to verify infinity; the gist is playback should not stop; is not seekable).

8. Matroska issues
   * PR #447 has been under a lot of discussion in Github. We're ready to merge this PR.
   * We're working on code now, so not a lot of changes to the spec this month.
    * issue about negative delay in ... ? https://www.reddit.com/r/mkvtoolnix/comments/l4uh6z/audio_delay_working_when_played_on_computer_not/

9. FLAC issues
   * none other than lack of editor going forward

AOB?

    NEXT MEETING February 23, 2021.
