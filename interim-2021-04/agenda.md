4.  WG status update

   * draft-ietf-cellar-codec-05 was posted 2020-10-19, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20 was posted 2020-12-01, was approved before IETF 110, is now in RFC Editor Queue
   * draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4-16 was posted 2020-12-01, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-06 was posted 2020-10-19, in ID Exists
   * draft-ietf-cellar-tags-05 was posted 2020-10-19, in ID Exists
   * FLAC specification has not been posted to the datatracker yet
   
   * We agreed at the December 2020 meeting that we would have a focused conversation about FFV1 v4 in our February meeting, and noted then that the April 2021 date is not realistic. At this point, NONE of our existing dates are realistic. We'll discuss on this call. 

   * Milestone review:  Matroska maybe at the end of Summer 2021? It's closer than we thought
   * FLAC just needs an editor to complete the work.
   * FFV1-v4 requires more research, and it is unclear when we will know what a realistic goal date is. 

5.  2021 virtual interim meeting dates

   * Please note that the our 2021 dates listed at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/meetings/
   * Determination of whether IETF 111 in July will be able to meet in person, to be made in a month or two. 
   * Sometime around 2021-09-28, we’ll see if we want to meet at IETF 112 on November 6-12, 2021, in person in Madrid.

6.  Celebration of FFV1 approval for publication as RFC, with minor cleanup
   * IESG ballot positions at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1/ballot/

   * We will have our second RFC "Real Soon Now"
   * We need to pay close attention to normative references, especially if they are really informative
   * FFV1 doesn't actually have a normative dependency on Matroska - are any other normative dependencies actually informative? If so, we can ask that these changes be made during AUTH48, with AD concurrence.
   * RFC Editor has made the change to Matroska (being Informative) with AD approval, so the draft is not blocked on MISS\*REF (missing normative reference)

7.  From the mailing list: Normative references that are actually Informative references
   * Do we have anything else to change, in FFv1?
   * Do we have anything to change in other specifications?
   
ACTION: mcr to have two other normative references in FFv1 changed to informative.
    
8.   FFV1 v4 issues 

   * too soon to figure out what are the major differences yet to do in v4.
   * there are still open possibilities in performance without changing the v3 bitstream format, and those that do not work, will make up the v4 changeset.
   * we can close #240 (as soon as we figure out how)
   
9.  Matroska issues
   * Discussion on Github issues, especially on chapters

10. FLAC issues
   * Michael has reached out to Florin to see about his interest in helping with this document, but we don't have an answer from him. 
       * no response to email Feb. 23.

ACTION: Dave will repost flac document with new version number.
