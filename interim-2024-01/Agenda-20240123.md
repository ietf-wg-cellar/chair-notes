###  Milestone review:

   * draft-ietf-cellar-flac-14 - All discusses cleared, but we have a new normative reference. Details below.
   * Update milestones, adding draft-ietf-cellar-chapter-codecs and updating dates for remaining docs, right?

### Next steps for additional Matroska specifications (three of which are expired)

   * We're still going to do these, right? 

### FLAC [IESG ballot](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-flac/ballot/) 

   * Moving the picture types defined in [ID3v2] to an IANA registry gave us a new normative downref for [RFC2083].
   * Thre requrement is that normative references from a higher-maturity specification (in our case, Propose Standard) to a lower-maturity specification (in our case, Informational) must be identified in the [Last Call announcement](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cellar/jbOdqGs8gxYTPeQqwJablhusapQ/). 
   * After a downref has been evaluated as part of a Last Call for any document, the reference can be added to the [downref registry](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref), but [RFC2083] isn't in that registry (yet)
   * Murray is checking with the IESG to see how he should proceed
   * No action needed at this time from the working group or from Martijn
   * For the group - This wasn't actually anyone's fault - Spencer thought we weren't allocating any new code points, because we were copying the picture types into a new IANA registry with no changes, but we actually WERE allocating new code points **to the IANA registry**
 
### New revision for FFV1v4

   * Email thread is [here](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cellar/v4ABpkL2u0OQgcCzO4G5zFsCXLo/)
   * 

### Update on patch for FFv1 versions 1-3?

   * Jérôme said at our last meeting that we have a patch for FFv1 versions 1-3 (odd width or height, and chroma subsampling) that he needs to review again, and it may require an errata.
   * 

## AOB?

Next meeting is 2024-02-27.
