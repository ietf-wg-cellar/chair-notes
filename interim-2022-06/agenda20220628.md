###  Milestone review:

   * done last time.
   * FLAC -  will not make July 2022 milestone. What is realistic update for milestone?

##### Discussion on the call
   * ffv1 is close expiry (31 May 2022) , so someone needs to take on renewing it.
   * NoTimeToWait 2022 might be October 26-28, 2022.
   * cellar-tags will now get some attention from Steve.

### Matroska issues - Discussion on the call
   * WGLC has ended, and new version -10 has been posted.  
   * Spencer or Michael to be document shepherd, and pass it on to AD for review.
       * Now in WG Consensus: Waiting for Write-Up.

### FLAC issues - Discussion on the call
   * Document now being led by Martijn van Beurden, seems to be making significant progress.
   * Jerome posted issue that we should include container mappings, specifically for Ogg. For Matroska can just refer to Matroska ID. But, not sure about mp4. Needs help determining whether MP4 should be addressed in the document. 
   * https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/flac-specification/issues/112
   * The registry we're talking about is for MP4, not from IANA. 
   * Container mappings could be their own documents, don't have to have be part of the base FLAC specification.
   * Martjin will reach out to Apple and ask what they want to allocate an MP4 container number for FLAC, cc: MCR. It would be best if we could list the MP4 container identifier for FLAC in the RFC, before it is published, or at worst, during AUTH48.
   * 

### FFV1 v4 issues - Discussion on the call
   * maybe focus of June call.
   
## AOB?
   * Next meeting is 2022-06-28 - we skip July
